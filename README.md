# TCP-Proxy
This is a simple implementation of how data can be sent through TCP to a server via a proxy in go.


This project demos the transfer of a file in the given flow.

```client --> proxy  -->  server```

## Try it out?
clone this directory.
open up 3 terminal tabs
navigate to the `client` `proxy` and `server` directories

```bash
go run main.go
```

Note: run the `client` project only after the `server` and `proxy-server` is running.
